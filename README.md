# D2-MapID-Finder
Little helping hand to share your map seeds with others!

If you add the parameter "-seed %number%" to your Diablo 2 shortcut, much like -3dfx or -w, it forces the seed in singleplayer to whatever you pass as %number%. You can exploit this behavior to save and share map layouts, since rerolling your map is based on this very seed. Whenever the map is supposed to change, so either via PlugY's AlwaysRegenMapInSP setting or when changing difficulties, the game will always roll the same map.
I created this tool in the hope that people share nice map seeds they rolled, for example perfect Trav or LK maps, and this tool might be handy to share these layouts!

UI should be self-explanatory. I suggest putting the jar-file in your save directory so the file chooser instantly points to where your save files are located. The "Share" button will overwrite your current clipboard contents, so don't copy your dissertation to your clipboard and delete the files before using this tool.

Not quite sure which Java version you need to run it, but everything above 7 is definitely fine.

## Additional note:
If you like this tool, I wrote another one that lets you change your map ID without running the -seed command. You can check it out here:
